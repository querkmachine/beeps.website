This accessibility statement applies to the website hosted at **beeps.website**. It does not include subdomains of that domain, my other websites, or my presence on third-party websites or services.

I want as many people as possible to be able to view and use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Change colours, contrast levels and fonts using your browser or device settings.
- Zoom in up to 400% without needing to horizontally scroll to view content.
- Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard, mouse, or speech recongition software.
- Listen to most of the website using a screen reader.

If you have a disability and need advice on making your device easier to use, AbilityNet publishes [simple 'how to' guides on how to change your device settings](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/).

## Compliance status

This website aims to comply with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), level AA standard.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

There are no known areas where the website does not meet the WCAG 2.2 level AA standard.

### Disproportionate burden

None.

### Content not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

Some pages feature content embedded from third-party sources, such as YouTube. As this content is hosted by a third-party, I'm unable to guarantee that it is accessible.

### Other accessibility concerns

These issues do not constitute a failure under WCAG 2.2 Level AA criteria, however may still represent a degraded experience or accessibility barrier to users.

- The bottom border of the website header isn't visible in forced colours mode.
- The about and now pages use system emoji as iconography. Not all devices are capable of rendering emoji or the full range of emoji. Additionally, these may create a confusing and overly verbose experience for screen reader users.
- The GOV.UK browser data page requires two-dimensional scrolling to view the full content of data tables. This isn't a failure under [WCAG's Reflow criterion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html), which has an exception for data tables, but may be difficult for some users to navigate.
