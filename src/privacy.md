This website does not store cookies on your device for any reason.

This website doesn't collect any information about the users or devices who visit it, other than the basic access and error logs that are created by my hosting provider.

These logs are kept to help identify problems and certain security issues—locating the source of a [denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), for example—and are automatically deleted after seven days.

The same guarantee cannot be made for any content embedded from third-party websites (e.g. YouTube videos), though I minimise how much they can collect if the option is available.

That's about it. I honestly don't collect any sort of analytics at all, even anonymous ones. If only the rest of the web were that way.
