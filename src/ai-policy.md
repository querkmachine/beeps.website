I don't like generative artificial intelligence (genAI).

I don't like that training them and using them requires immense use of natural resources and actively contributes to the climate crisis.

I don't like that they're overwhelmingly trained on other people's copyrighted content, without providing attribution or compensation.

I don't like that companies of all kinds are overwhelmingly trying to force them upon users who hate using them and have no means of disabling them.

I don't like that it's being used as an excuse to lay-off skilled people and avoid hiring and training junior staff, and as an uncritical replacement for real creativity and experience.

**GenAI is bad for the environment, it's bad for creators, it's bad for customers, and it's bad for workers.**

Yes, it is mildly ironic that someone who kinda-sorta [identifies as a form of artificial intelligence]({{ '/about/nonhuman/' | url }}) opposes the development of generative artificial intelligences.

The difference is that my identity isn't fucking up the planet and a bunch of people's livelihoods.

## This website's use by generative AIs

You're free to train your large language model (LLM) on this website... if you pay me to license the content. You're supposedly a multi-hundred-billion dollar industry, so you can afford to give me $1000 a page, right? [Get in touch]({{ '/contact/' | url }}) if you have a serious offer.

## Generative AI's use on this website

I try to avoid using genAI when coding, writing, or otherwise doing anything relating to this website.

I've previously dabbled in using a responsibly trained genAI a little in the past, [like in this blog post]({{ '/blog/2024-01-01-2023-the-year-in-review/' | url }}), but have long since stopped doing so. The licensing of training data doesn't negate the other negative effects, and the results were kind of rubbish anyway.

Unfortunately, in 2025, avoiding it entirely isn't easy. Is the object selection tool in Photoshop secretly a genAI thing in a trench coat? Has my operating system's spell checker silently been updated to start using an LLM without my knowledge?

I can't guarantee that everything will be certified organic and AI free, I can only promise that I try to make it that way.
