          Originally the Bristol Bronies, the Severn Bronies is a community hub
          serving the My Little Pony fandom in south-west England and south Wales.
          We organise and hold meets every week, ranging from small socials to
          elaborate events incorporating gaming, cosplay, vendors, live
          programming, and more. We’ve popped up in the media a few times,
          including in the Bristol Post, BBC Points West, BBC Inside Out, and
          Jeremy Vine’s Radio 2 show.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make efforts to be active in the community and have fundraised for
          local charities, as well as having our own network for supporting
          transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. I organise the meets,
          perform administrative and financial duties, and design and maintain the
          group’s website and brand identity.

          Lead front-end developer &amp; accessibility and inclusivity advocate<br />
          at Felinesoft, Bristol
        </h3>

      <div>
        <p>
          Felinesoft is a flat-hierarchy Microsoft .NET development agency. My
          primary role is to take designs and turn them into design systems whilst
          embedding progressive enhancement principles, accessibility and
          responsive design in the process. Here I’ve worked with dozens of
          clients including the Royal Photographic Society, Rolls-Royce Motor
          Cars, Jack Daniel&rsquo;s, The Kennel Club, and the British Association
          for Counselling and Psychotherapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In carrying out this role I defined evolutionary (and at times,
          revolutionary) process changes to embed best practice into every part of
          the design and development process. I also created a raft of open- and
          closed-source frameworks including FSForms, a best-practice forms
          library; Kickstart, a Fractal-based design system framework; and
          Felafel, a services-oriented bootstrapping library.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also worked as a PHP developer, graphic designer, UX and UI
          designer on disparate projects where those skills were required.

          management and server administration work for a number of high-profile
          clients, including Drinkaware, Brothers Cider, the BMJ, and Glorious
          Brands; working as lead developer on some projects.

        <p>
          In my free time I’ve written a bunch of open-source stuff, including

    Please note: I legally changed my name in 2015 for personal reasons. As a
    result, certifications, references and other documentation from before then
    (as well as certain documents from afterwards) may be under a different
    name. Don’t be surprised if you reach out to my university and they’ve never
    heard of me!
