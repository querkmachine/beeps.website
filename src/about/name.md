title: My name is beeps
---

{% block main %}
I go by the name beeps. It's short, to the point, and I like it.

It's a shortened version 'batbeeps', one of my online usernames, so a handful of people have been calling me it for years already!

I tend to write beeps entirely in lowercase, but [this is just an aesthetic preference](https://tweets.beeps.website/1592264839778340864/) and I don't really mind how it's capitalised.

For contexts that demand [a 'human' name]({{ '/about/robot/' | url }}), I go by Kim Grey.

My legal name is Kimberly, which I don't intend to change it at this time, however I'd prefer people use beeps or Kim, as [I don't want to use a feminine-coded name]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}) where possible.

## Other names

I've recently started using a 'designation' in contexts related to [my robot identity]({{ '/about/robot/' | url }}): B47&zwj;-&zwj;R0.

In some contexts I may go by Emy, the name of [my fursona]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}).

When referred to in combination with [Olive]({{ '/about/olive/' | url }}), we go by the Nebula System.
