title: I don't have a gender
---

I am [agender](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Agender). This means that I do not consider myself to be female, male, or anywhere on the gender identity spectrum. It's considered to be a form of non-binary gender identity.

This is because I find gender to be irrelevant to how I perceive myself, live my life or interact with others.

## Pronouns and titles

I use [it/its pronouns](https://en.pronouns.page/it/its).

I'm conscious that many people feel uncomfortable using it/its pronouns as they consider them to be dehumanising, but given [I do not identify as human]({{ '/about/nonhuman/' | url }}), I hope that people try them out.

If you're still uncomfortable with using it/its, then use [singular they/them](https://en.pronouns.page/they/them).

I use the gender-neutral title 'Mx'.

In contexts where the gender binary is foolishly being enforced, I use [she/her pronouns](https://en.pronouns.page/she/her) and the title 'Ms'.

## Transgender status

I consider myself to be transgender—as my gender identity is not what was assigned at birth—and I take hormones with the intention of developing a more androgynous physical appearance.

## Background

I first publicly described being agender in 2013, in ["On Gender and Sexuality"]({{ '/blog/2014-07-16-on-gender-and-sexuality/' | url }}). As a part of this I started experimenting with my gender presentation and using alternative pronouns.

More than a year later, I started [identifying as a transgender woman]({{ '/blog/2014-07-10-the-long-walk/' | url }}), on the basis of my physical dysphoria and because I found feminine gender presentation to be more satisfying than masculine presentation. I [adopted a new name]({{ '/blog/2014-07-12-whats-in-a-name/' | url }}) and she/her pronouns at this time.

However, over the following years, my comfort with feminine gender presentation started to wane. Following [my exploration into machine identity]({{ '/blog/2022-08-11-not-human-after-all/' | url }}), I returned to identifying as agender and explicitly using it/its pronouns.
