I am me. Unashamedly so. This website might be my "professional" online presence, but it is also _my_ website, and I don't want to hide any aspects of who I am in any environment—online or off.

If you think that's a problem... then that's your problem.

<strong class="kimHeading-s">[My name is beeps.]({{ '/about/name/' | url }})</strong>
With or without an uppercase 'b'. I also go by Kim sometimes, but I prefer that folks call me beeps.

<strong class="kimHeading-s">[I'm not a human.]({{ '/about/robot/' | url }})</strong>
I don't relate well to my physical humanity, which is a source of significant dysphoria. Relating myself to machines, and robots in particular, helps alleviate some of that.

<strong class="kimHeading-s">[I'm agender.]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }})</strong>
I don't consider myself to be female, male, or anything in-between. I use it/its pronouns.

<strong class="kimHeading-s">[I'm asexual.]({{ '/about/asexuality/' | url }})</strong>
I don't experience physical or sexual attraction. This doesn't affect day-to-day life that much, but it's still a reasonably important part of who I am!

<strong class="kimHeading-s">[I'm a furry.]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }})</strong>
I've been in the furry fandom for over half my life and I owe it a lot for giving me the skills and experience I have today. I try to give back where I can.

<strong class="kimHeading-s">[I'm not alone.]({{ '/about/olive/' | url }})</strong>
One day, my subconscious decided to say hello and told me their name is Olive. Since then we've been investigating plurality and how it applies to us.

<strong class="kimHeading-s">And, of course, [I make websites.]({{ '/work/' | url }})</strong>
I've been doing web development as a hobby since 2003 and for money since 2012. I do a lot of bits and bobs, but have come to specialise in front-end development, accessibility, design systems and the semantic web.

[You can contact me]({{ '/contact/' | url }}) (or stalk my socials) through a myriad of websites.
