**Call me:** beeps (Kim is fine but not preferred)
**My pronouns are:** it/its (they/them is fine but not preferred)

## Communicating via messenger or email

**I vastly prefer asyncronous methods of communication**, such as email or messengers. They give me time to digest questions, perform research and refine answers. Using them is always preferred over syncronous methods. [The contact page]({{ '/contact/' | url }}) has my most preferred platforms, if you don't have me on a more personal messenger.

The times I'm available online can be erratic, and the times I'm in the right mental space to be social are even more erratic. **You may not get a response to your message quickly, or ever.** 

This is even more true if I'm currently working, travelling, or doing something else that might take away my attention at a moment's notice. **If you've gone longer than 24 hours without a response, feel free to poke me again.**

Please **don't expect me to carry a conversation**. Ideally only start talking to me if you have something to talk about!

## Communicating in-person or via phone call

**I generally have social anxiety and [dysphoria]({{ '/gender/' | url }}).** I will rarely show my face in photos or on video, substituting [my fursona]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}) instead, and on some days I will avoid speaking as well. 

**Please ask before taking any photos or recordings** and give some indication of where they will be uploaded, if they will be shared online.

I have audio processing issues and struggle to separate conflicting sounds and language sources. For example, I cannot easily understand a strong accent if there is a lot of background noise, discern one conversation from another conversation happening nearby, or write about what someone is saying at the same time as listening to them. **I may need you to repeat things multiple times.**

I will be overly-conscious about 'butting in' and will either wait for a period of extended silence or an invitation to contribute before I say anything. **Prompting me for my thoughts is really helpful**, assuming you want them!

**I'm awful at small talk**, so don't really expect me to make any. I'm perfectly happy just silently hanging around with people, so don't feel the need to fill an awkward silence.

## Useful bits to keep in mind

Like many [a neurodivergent critter]({{ '/about/neurodivergent/' | url }}), **I don't really experience relationship degradation**. That means we could have not spoken for months or years, but I'll still consider you a friend. Don't be afraid of reaching out even if we've not spoken before (or ever), I really appreciate it.

### Health issues

**I'm harder of hearing in my left ear**, so will usually try to position myself to the left of where others are in group settings, and may turn my head weirdly to hear you better.
 
I have a sleep disorder, which gives me varying levels of energy from day to day. It's not uncommon for me to fall asleep suddenly or in unusual circumstances, or to experience episodes of 'microsleep' where I repeatedly fall asleep and wake up again in the middle of activities. **Just wake me up** if these happen, and please don't be offended.

### Plurality

**There's [a couple of us]({{ '/about/olive/' | url }}) in here.** Although 99% of the time you'll be chatting to beeps, others may also be around. You can say hi to them!
