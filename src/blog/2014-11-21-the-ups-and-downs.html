  Yesterday I was feeling a bit rubbish about trans things. Having my friends
  being so far ahead in the whole process is kind of frustrating and jealousy
  inducing at times. I didn’t speak up about it, and although a temporary
  frustration it’s another little niggle that I let get to me more than I should
  have.

  Today has been better. I went on a shopping trip with my friend who really
  pushed me to try things (something I really need, given how timid and easily
  embarrassed I am alone) and I came out of it with some nice new clothes and a
  teensy bit more progress with replacing my wardrobe and getting more used to
  the impracticalities (but ridiculous comfort) of women’s clothing.

<p>Hopefully there’s more todays to come.</p>
