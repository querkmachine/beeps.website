I’ve been lax updating this blog. I’ve been meaning to update it for literally months, but I’ve been procrastinating something fierce. I historically don’t like talking about my problems, and I think that sense was crawling back to me.

Regardless, some (though not much) progress has been made. More people than ever now know of my identity and intentions, and I’m logistically closer to living my day-to-day life as I actually want—a process that can be expidited once I’ve managed to move out.

I know it’s a slow process, and it feels as slow as ever; but as long as some progress is being made then I feel like I can get through it.

I hope that 2015 can be the year when everything changes.
