So, [notorious queerphobe](asexuality), [Holocaust-denier](holocaust), and ["ethnically mean-spirited"](leguin) sometimes-author JK Rowling has decided to publish an ~open letter~ rant complaining about, what else, but supporters of transgender rights.

This came in response to a great number of public letters coming from [writers](writers), [actors](actors), [musicians](musicians), [doctors and biologists](doctors), [historians](historians), [feminist academics](feminists), [charities](charities), [LGBTQ+ organisations](organisations), the [Common's Joint Committee on Human Rights](committee), and myriad individual politicians and organisations, criticising the Supreme Court ruling and subsequently rushed Equality and Human Rights Commission guidance.

We can only assume she's frustrated that being the billionaire backer of a successful court case doesn't automatically make people agree with you.

Rowling's letter is, as you might expect, littered with falsehoods about human biology and transgender people, as well as an awful lot of projection of her own behaviour onto others. Some of it so densely, rudamentally false that I just felt like it warranted a blog post.

{% callout %}
This post is, by nature, going to contain some unpleasantly transphobic content from this point onwards.

Let's get into it:

> In light of recent open letters from academia and the arts criticising the UK's Supreme Court ruling on sex-based rights, it's possibly worth remembering that nobody sane believes, or has ever believed, that humans can change sex, or that binary sex isn't a material fact.

Rowling is quick to paint anyone who doesn't side with her as being mentally insane (which is _totally_ a sane thing to do, folks).

As noted in the aforementioned [open letter from doctors and biologists](doctors), sex is not determined as a binary but as a collection of attributes. Those attributes are not fixed at birth and can change in later life—which they naturally do for all humans.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is taken by both transgender and cisgender people for different reasons, accellerates these changes, having a direct influence on physiology and gene expression, going so far as to restructure DNA itself.

So yes, humans can change sex, actually.

> These letters do nothing but remind us of what we know only too well: that pretending to believe these things has become an elitist badge of virtue.

It feels terribly ironic for the billionaire using her wealth to try and force a more restricted and exclusive definition of something onto other people to accuse others of elitism. Is she so unaware that _she_ is the elitist? Was smoking cigars and drinking champagne on her private yacht, in [a manner reminiscent of your most stereotypical elitist](elitist) not obvious enough?

Is she so unaware that loudly talking about her opinions all day and night to a captive audience whilst funding groups to amplify those opinions is essentially the most 'virtue signalling' stance you can have?

Terrible lack of self-awareness on her part.

> I often wonder whether the signatories of such letters have to quieten their consciences before publicly boosting a movement intent on removing women's and girls' rights [...]

Replace "women's and girls' rights" with "transgender people's rights" and the same criticism can be made for Rowling herself.

This supposition is logically flawed anyway: no one is asking to take away the rights of women, they're asking to receive the _same rights_ as women.

It's the same ludicrous logic that was used by opponents of same-sex marriage who argued that granting equal marriage rights equated to straight people losing them. It's plainly not true.

> [...] which bullies gay people who admit openly they don't want opposite sex partners [...]

You think the LGBTQ+ community, whose very existence is contingent upon the liberalisation of who you're allowed to love and be in relationships with, systematically polices who you're allowed to love and be in relationships with?

This just doesn't happen.

> [...] and campaigns for the continued sterilisation of vulnerable and troubled kids.

[Puberty blockers are proven safe](blockers) and the effects of taking them have no permanent effects. They have been used for various treatments, gender-affirming care amongst them, for several decades, without ill effects. Puberty blockers have no effect on fertility.

Rowlings use of "vulnerable and troubled kids" feels like such a scapegoat here. Much like the recent reports that transgender youth in the UK will undergo [mandatory autism screening](autism), it stinks of wanting to restrict the autonomy and self-determination of trans people.

Being neurodivergent does not make someone less transgender, nor does it give anyone else the right to deny them gender-affirming care.

> Do they feel any qualms at all while chanting the foundational lie of their religion: Trans Women are Women, Trans Men are Men?

Rowling's criticism of the transgender rights movement as a "religion" is a funny one here, given that it's quite easy to place the so-called "gender critical" movement as being a cult: it has a handful of leaders with overwhelming influence over the rest (such as Maya Forrester, Posie Parker, and Rowling herself), established and well-funded organisations specific to their goals, and a habit of painting its members as ostracised from mainstream society regardless of how much influence they hold.

Conversely, the trans community is a diaspora with little organisation or established leadership. It's just people trying to live their lives.

> I have no idea. All I know for sure is that it's a complete waste of time telling a gender activist that their favourite slogan is self-contradictory nonsense [...]

Not directly related, but I want to take this opportunity to point out that the Supreme Court ruling about this is also self-contradictory nonsense.

As noted in [an extensive blog post by Kim Hipwell](hipwell), the ruling simultaneously decides that a "woman" for the purposes of the Equality Act is a "biological woman", but goes on to (very poorly) define the biological grouping of women in ways so vague that it ultimately includes transgender people.

There's a reason so many people call the ruling confused and unclear in its intentions.

> [...] because the lie is the whole point. They're not repeating it because it's true - they know full well it's not true - but because they believe they can make it true, sort of, if they force everyone else to agree.

As mentioned above, saying that human sex is binary is a lie, and that lie is the whole point.

It's also obvious, again through Rowling's funding of organisations specific to pushing her agenda in law, politics and medicine, that her own goal is to "force everyone else to agree".

> The foundational lie functions as both catechism and crucifix: the set form of words that obviates the tedious necessity of coming up with your own explanation of why you're one of the Godly, and an exorcist's weapon which will defeat demonic facts and reason, and promote the advance of righteous pseudoscience and sophistry.

This word salad is basically just complaining about people saying "trans women are women" again, but with the added layer of implying her views are "facts and reason" whilst those of her opponents are "pseudoscience and sophistry".

As already mentioned, her own view of sex and gender are those opposed to most mainstream biology and medicine, so there's not much more to add. If she were a better writer, she probably would've edited this part out.

> Some argue that signatories of these sorts of letters are motivated by fear: fear for their careers, of course, but also fear of their co-religionists [...]

This is another great example of Rowling lacking in self-awareness. No one is _compelled_ to publicly support transgender rights, and there are a great number of celebrities who don't. They just had the common sense to not shout those views over and over again to an audience that didn't want to hear them.

> [...] who include angry, narcissistic men who threaten and sometimes enact violence on non-believers; [...]

To my research, there has never been a case of physical assault being enacted upon someone because they held transphobic views.

Meanwhile, [hate crimes against transgender people](hatecrimes) have risen year-on-year for the last several years. Between October 2023 and September 2024, [350 people were killed by transphobia-motivated violence](murders2024), 15 of whom were minors.

> [...] back-stabbing colleagues ever ready to report wrongthink; the online shamers and doxxers and rape threateners, [...]

"Back-stabbing colleagues" here is potentially a reference to multiple stars of the _Harry Potter_ films (particularly the leading trio) all having distanced themselves from Rowling because of her bigoted views.

Rowling has previously publicly criticised them as being "disloyal" to her (a toxic viewpoint in itself), so it's not unexpected that she continues to hold a grudge.

This, I think, points to Rowlings _real_ motivations for writing this essay: she's pissed off that people don't like her.

> and, of course, the influential zealots in the upper echelons of liberal professions (though we can quibble whether they're actually liberal at all, given the draconian authoritarianism that seems to have engulfed so many). Gender ideology could give medieval Catholicism a run for its money when it comes to punishing heretics, so isn't it common sense to keep your head down and recite your Hail Mulvaneys?

Once again, an ironic statement to make when it is her own views and actions that align closely with political authoritarianism and religious orthodoxy. It's [the likes of Vladamir Putin](putin), Donald Trump, Viktor Orbán and Alexander Lukashenko who are siding with Rowling, after all.

Even the late Pope Francis, who had otherwise quite conservative views on trans rights, [provided financial aid to trans sex workers](francis2), [accepted gender-affirming healthcare as necessary to save people's lives](francis3), and called for [transgender people to be accepted and integrated in society](francis).

In practice, it seems that Rowling is the one harbouring authoritarian and fundamentalist views.

> But before we start feeling too sorry for any cowed and fearful TWAWites who're TERFy on the sly, let's not forget what a high proportion of them have willingly snatched up pitchforks and torches to join the inquisitional purges.

> Call me lacking in proper womanly sympathy, but I find the harm they've enabled and in some cases directly championed or funded - the hounding and shaming of vulnerable women, the forced loss of livelihoods, the unregulated medical experiment on minors - tends to dry up my tears at source.
>
> History is littered with the debris of irrational and harmful belief systems that once seemed unassailable. As Orwell said, 'Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals believe them.' Gender ideology may have embedded itself deeply into our institutions, where it's been imposed, top-down, on the supposedly unenlightened, but it is not invulnerable.
>
> Court losses are starting to stack up. The condescension, overreach, entitlement and aggression of gender activists is eroding public support daily. Women are fighting back and winning significant victories. Sporting bodies have miraculously awoken from their slumber and remembered that males tend to be larger, stronger and faster than females. Parts of the medical establishment are questioning cutting healthy breasts off teenaged girls is really the best way to fix their mental health problems.
>
> One seemingly harmless little white lie - Trans Women are Women, Trans Men are Men - uttered in most cases without any real thought at all, and a few short years later, people who think of themselves as supremely virtuous are typing 'yes, rapists' pronouns are absolutely the hill I'll die on,' rubbing shoulders with those who call for women to be hanged and decapitated for wanting all-female rape crisis centres, and furiously denying clear and mounting evidence of the greatest medical scandal in a century.
>
> I wonder if they ever ask themselves how they got here, and I wonder whether any of them will ever feel shame.
