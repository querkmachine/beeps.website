> hey, i love the webdev guide so far!! do you happen to have any advice for ppl who have years of technical experience with html/css/etc but no job experience? i'm autistic and i've been messing around with webdev stuff since i was 8, but trying to find a job with no papers or job experience while autistic seems like such a daunting process to me.
