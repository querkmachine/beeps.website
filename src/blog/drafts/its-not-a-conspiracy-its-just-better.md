title: It's not a conspiracy, it's just making things better

People are generally untrustworthy of corporations nowadays. That's not only fair, it's often entirely justified: oil companies lied for decades about climate change, Facebook's algorithms have probably influenced the outcomes of elections, and Elon Musk continues to exist.

But I've found that this distrust has also led to some folks in my circles getting a little... conspiratorial about things. That might be a strong word, we're not talking raging QAnon supporters or flat-earther level stuff. There's just a persistent _vibe_ that if a company has done something they perceive as bad, there must be some grand ulterior motive behind doing it.

For example, hypothesising that modern devices having fewer user-serviceable parts is intentionally planned obsolescence, or that modern UI and website design has become bland because impersonal corporate interests pushed 'flat design' on everyone.

There may be some truth to these claims, but just as Occam's Razor would imply, the real reasons are often far simpler.

These things are better.

## For example, smartphones

We didn't end up in a world where nearly every smartphone is a thin, featureless, glass rectangle just because one or two people decided that it should be that way. Phones evolved to be that way, the process of natural selection via technical progress and market forces.

Headphone ports and physical buttons disappeared because they were a common point of failure, causing the phones to become difficult or impossible to use, whilst the device's internals might still be fine.

Replaceable batteries disappeared because the mechanisms for removing them took up space and compromised the devices being water resistant. Most people prefer having water resistant phones over replaceable batteries.

Glass-forward designs weren't created so that people broke and replaced (or repaired) their devices more often, they're to allow for features like wireless charging and to enable better network connectivity, as radio waves can't penetrate metal easily; and people would rather have fast network connectivity than a phone built like a tank.

One of the stories that bugs me most is people pointing at the [lawsuit over Apple's throttling of CPU's on older iPhones](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54996601) as proof of intentional planned obselesence—in complete ignorance of the fact that Apple did this to extend the life of worn batteries.

The lawsuit was successful because Apple didn't inform users that they were doing it, not because of the actual throttling, which seems pretty on par with Apple's public relations strategy to this day—they don't like making a big deal about issues.

## And websites

Many people point to Windows 8 and iOS 7 (released in 2012 and 2013, respectively) as ushering in the 'flat design' era, where everything is ungradiented, unshadowed, and in bright, simple colours, in stark contrast to Web 2.0's gradient and emboss-heavy designs and the highly-detailed skeuomorphic design principles that iOS had used up until that point.

Some folks blame this shift on the corporitsation of design: a preference for unopinionated blandness with mass-market appeal over
