I keep having the idea of writing listicle like blog posts. Not for easy clicks or engagement, but just to share things—software, films, music—that I think are neat.

However, rather than give myself a year's worth of easy and boring content, I figured I'd just get them over with and chuck everything your way in one big list of lists.

## 10 macOS utility apps I find really quite useful

Here are some teeny, tiny utility apps I've found very useful when it comes to being productive. Most of them do one thing and they do it well, [as it should well be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well).

Some are free, some are paid, some have free basic features and paid expanded features. Not endorsed, not affiliate links, I've put them here because I actually use them every day, etc.

List items are in no particular order.

1. **[MeetingBar](https://meetingbar.leits.me/)** (free) — Takes the remote meetings in your calendar, puts them in your menu bar, with nice notifications and shortcuts to join meetings in Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and others.
2. **[Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amphetamine/id937984704)** (free) — Stops your Mac from going to sleep, with so many configuration options you won't know what to do with them.
3. **[AirBuddy](https://airbuddy.app/)** (paid) — For iOS-style AirPod pairing on the surface. Enables a whole bunch of useful tools for all sorts of Bluetooth headphones and devices underneath.
4. **[ColorSlurp](https://colorslurp.com/)** (free with some paid features) — Pick colours from stuff, fiddle around with them, check for accessible contrast ratios, and build palettes for later.
5. **[QuickShade](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/quickshade/id931571202)** (free) — Using an external display? Want to turn down the brightness without having to fiddle with hardware buttons? QuickShade can do that with magic.
6. **[Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066)** (free) — Hide menu bar icons, either temporarily or permanently. Basically the main part of Bartender but it's free.
7. **[Flotato](https://www.flotato.com/)** (free for one instance, paid if you want to run multiple) — Takes webapps and lets you 'install' them as regular macOS apps. Useful for things like Overcast or Netflix which don't have first-party macOS apps.
8. **[The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/)** (free) — Opens dozens of archive file formats outside of the ones macOS supports natively. You might not need it often, but at some point you _will_ need it.
9. **[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)** (free) — Rebind keysboard keys and mouse buttons to do whatever you want. I like to rebind Caps Lock to be a 'hyper key', which I use heavily in combination with the last item on this list.
10. **[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)** (free) — Spotlight replacement and the exception to my 'do one thing' rule—Raycast does bloody everything. Searching, calculations, conversions, window management, clipboard history, snippets, and even more via the extensions library—and basically all of it can be done using keyboard shortcuts.

## 10 music tracks that punch me right in the feels

For me, music is so often about the lyrics and the story being told through them. All of these songs have lyrics that I relate to in some manner, some of them are loud and brash, often purposefully so, but they all make me feel something.

List items are in no particular order.

1. **["Shield" by Girls Rituals](https://blacksquares.bandcamp.com/track/shield)** — A song about feeling trapped whilst wanting to help others feel less trapped. If dysphoria was a song, for me, this would be it.
2. **["ANTONYMPH" by Vylet Pony](https://vyletpony.bandcamp.com/track/antonymph)** — A song about embracing the things you love despite what other people might think. A message I've only taken to heart only more with age.
3. **["Blue Heaven" by Public Service Broadcasting](https://song.link/gb/i/1566583345)** — A song about defining yourself on your own terms and making your own happiness despite what other people might think. Similar to "ANTONYMPH" in pure vibes.
4. **["One Day Like This" by Elbow](https://song.link/gb/i/1440767216)** — A song about seizing the day anew, despite any past indiscretions. An amazing alarm clock song, which I actually used for years without ever tiring of.
5. **["Blue" by Ken Ashcorp](https://kenashcorp.bandcamp.com/track/blue)** — A song about unrequited love. Wildly different in tone from most of Ken Ashcorp's discography, which just makes it all the more special, in my opinion.
6. **["You Will See Me" by Dan le Sac vs. Scroobius Pip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOP2NUbG2iY)** — A song about being dumped and channeling grief into defiant, vengeful self improvement. Maybe not the best message, but it makes you feel fucking good.
7. **["30" by Bo Burnham](https://song.link/gb/i/1571419360)** — A song about firmly becoming an adult member of society and feeling utterly unprepared for that role. This came out literally a couple of months before I turned 30. I am still unprepared for that role.
8. **["Look At The Sky" by Porter Robinson](https://song.link/gb/i/1550626760)** — A song about overcoming creative block and imposter syndrome. That's the Genius breakdown of it anyway, but to me, this song just feels like it's about _survival_. About making it to the other side of any struggle, wounded, but surviving.
9. **["Rebuild Me" by Jeff Burgess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Ygda4YqTM)** — A song about completely submitting every part of yourself to another person's control. No idea what this says about me. Moving on.
10. **["This Is A Life" by Son Lux, Mitski & David Byrne](https://sonlux.bandcamp.com/track/this-is-a-life-extended)** — A song about life in all its unremarkable averageness, and how that's not necessarily a bad thing. A pick-me-up, in a weird way.

## 10 simulation/management games I've spent way too much time playing

I tend to make it known that I don't play a lot of video games. I just don't gel with the whole concept of 'challenge as fun', really. I don't want stress, or missions, or even storyline, really—I want a sandbox, a tool I can use to make my own fun in my own way.

Games like that, thankfully, do exist. Here are my favourites.

1. **The Sims**
2. **_[Cities: Skylines]()_**
3. **_[Prison Architect]()_**
4. **_[OpenTTD]()_**
5. **RollerCoaster Tycoon 2**
6. **_[Two Point Hospital]()_**
7. **_[Garry's Mod]()_**
8. **_[Airport CEO]()_**
9. **Factorio**
10. **Planet Zoo**
