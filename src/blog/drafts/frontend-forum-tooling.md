[Ninji on Mastodon](https://wuffs.org/@Ninji) asked:

> Tooling is one that immediately comes to mind. I don't do front-end stuff often, and there's an overwhelming amount of choices.
>
> Webpack? Importing CSS/JS from random CDNs? Other packers? When are these appropriate (or not appropriate)? Should I be using the same tooling for a single-file proof-of-concept as I do for a big behemoth project?
