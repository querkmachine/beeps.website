title: Rating every _Star Trek_ opening sequence
tags: [random]

Series 14 of the modern reboot of _Doctor Who_ is fast approaching, with a few special episodes featuring some old faces due to debut next month before Russell T. Davies' second stint as showrunner begins in earnest.

And yet, weirdly, one of the parts I'm most excited about seeing is the opening title sequence.

_Doctor Who_ has had pretty much the same basic formula for its opening sequence ever since it debuted in 1963: the camera flying through some variant of time and or space (sometimes abstractly, sometimes more literally) to some orchestration of Rob Grainer's original theme.

It's iconic. It manages to consistently be mysterious, unearthly, and a bit scary.

And that's why this post is **not** about _Doctor Who_ openings. All of them are tweaks on a pretty consistent baseline, which makes ranking them somewhat arbitrary in my mind. Some versions are better than others, sure, but none are exceptionally better or worse than the average.

Thus the pivot to this post's title series, _Star Trek_.

_Star Trek_ is probably my biggest media-related interest. I've watched (nearly) every episode at least once, and often multiple times. I have the merch, the drip, the pseudo-encyclopaedic knowledge about fictional engineering principles and the semi-committed involvement in the surrounding fan community.

For those interested, I've yet to see the last half of the last season of _The Original Series_, which I've been slowly working through in my free time. I've also not seen most episodes of _The Animated Series_ yet.

Controversial opinion zone: Both TOS and TAS are so far out of step with the universe established in later _Trek_ shows that I kind of treat them more like background reading than as fully canon parts of the franchise.

If you wanna explain how Starfleet had and abandoned reliable time travel, personal independent forcefields and a "no women captains" policy in the space of five years, be my guest.

And unlike _Doctor Who_, each _Star Trek_ show has a totally different opening sequence to the others, trying to fit the vibes of their respective programmes. Some shows even acquired different opening sequences during their original runs.

There's still a formulaicness—virtually all of them feature a montage of the show's hero ship flying through space—but each gets its own theme song and its own vibe that it needs to instill, because no two _Treks_ are the same.

These ratings are, of course, still entirely based on my own thoughts and opinions.
