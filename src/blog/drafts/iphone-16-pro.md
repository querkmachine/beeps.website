A little over a month ago, whilst vibing in Cardiff city centre, I made a little bit of an impulse purchase and purchased an iPhone 16 Pro (titanium black, 256 GB storage).

And not really for any good reason. My 14 Pro (purple, 128 GB) still worked brilliantly, still got new updates, was barely any slower than the day it was purchased. I would normally use my phone for at least four or five years before I would consider replacing it.

So why upgrade after only two?
