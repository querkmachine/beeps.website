In 2022, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively known as Daniels), released <i>Everything Everywhere All At Once</i>, a movie about a Chinese woman struggling to do her taxes.

In the year following release, it won 208 different awards, including seven Oscars.

EEAAO is my favourite movie ever. If you have not watched it, you should watch it. Literally, use your next couple of hours of free time to sit down and watch it with your full attention. If you take it to heart, it's practically life changing.

If you need more than my just commanding you to be convinced, keep reading. There are no major spoilers in this post. It's literally just me gushing about how I think everyone should see this film.

## What is EEAAO?

The first question many people ask when I tell them to watch EEAAO is 'what genre is it?', which is where we encounter the first problem.

<i>Everything Everywhere All At Once</i> is... **everything**. It's a drama, a comedy, a romance, an animation, a coming-of-age story, a sci-fi, a fantasy, and a martial arts action film with a story about family, heritage, generational trauma, mental health, LGBT issues, existentialism, self-worth, nihilism, and joy.
