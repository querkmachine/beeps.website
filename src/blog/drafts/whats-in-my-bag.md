## Body

- Apple Watch - Still using a Series 4! This baby is five years old this autumn, and it's still chugging along without any serious issues, the battery isn't what it once was, but it still lasts about 24 hours between charges. I'm likely to replace it if it loses support for new watchOS versions, though.

## Pockets

- Wallet - just a pretty regular, boring wallet. Has a lot of loyalty cards for restaurants that no longer exist in it.
- Keys - on a karabiner. Used to be a WikiFur one.
- Apple iPhone 14 Pro - tbh got totally sold on the Dynamic Island, wish more things used it.
- Apple Airpods Pro - what?

## Bag

The backpack itself is an [Inateck CB1001S](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0792H9CFS/) one off t'internet. I got it after using a [Wiwu OnePack](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/onepack/onepack-most-functional-backpack-for-everyday-life) for a couple of years. It was a very nice bag, pretty much perfect for my needs, but the build quality wasn't great and the Kickstarter went a bit ðŸ˜¬.

The side pockets have:

- One that I reserve for holding drinks. I don't tend to have a consistent water bottle on me, so it's just whatever bottle or can I have at the time.
- An umbrella. It's Britain, it's gonna rain. I bought this umbrella for about Â£30 at a Marks and Spencer like eight years ago. It has never failed. Invest in your umbrellas.

### Main compartment

The main compartment is where I keep all my electronics.

- Apple Macbook Pro - I have two, one for the day job and one for my own use. Which one I have depends on what I'm up to.
- Apple iPad Air (5th generation) - Sometimes you don't need a whole laptop!
- [Bellroy Tech Kit](https://bellroy.com/products/tech-kit?color=slate&material=ribba_weave&size=standard) - Perhaps one of my most extavagent purchases, a Â£55 bag for cables. I mean, it's fucking good at holding cables. Includes in it:
  - Apple MacBook Pro power brick (the chonky 96 watt one)
  - Two folding wall plug to USB-C adaptors
  - USB-C to Lightning cable
  - USB-C to USB-C cable
  - USB-C to Magsafe cable
  - USB-C to Apple Watch cable
  - Apple Pencil 2
- Apple Magsafe Battery - My phone battery tends to easily last the day, I just keep this around in case of emergencies.

### Secondary compartment

This holds most of my miscellaneous stuff that just happens to be useful to have on me.

- Passport
- Some Mitsubishi Uni-Ball Eye pens. My favourite writing pens by far.
- Disposable face masks
- Hand sanitiser
- Tissues
