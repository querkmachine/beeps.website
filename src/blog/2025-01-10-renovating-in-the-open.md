Just a programming note that I'm making some big ol' changes to this website.

Not that interesting in itself, but I'm doing it "in the open", which is the modern web developer's hip new way of putting an under construction GIF on the homepage.

I'm not planning on any major overhauls, but enough stuff is going to be changed that it's likely to be janky for a little bit. Some stuff will get added, some stuff will get ripped out. I also can't guarantee that everything will be as accessible as I'd normally like during this time.

I'm going to be updating this blog post whenever a new thing has been changed, so keep your peepers on it!

## Ch-ch-ch-changelog

### 2025-01-10

The first "open" release. Notable changes include:

- Added **_more colours!_**
- Added a site-wide navigation menu.
- Added iconography in various places.
- Added a little colour bar beneath page titles because IDK.
- Redesigned how the site name/logo looks.
- Redesigned the site's footer.
- Redesigned links.
- Redesigned various in-page components, including callouts, character callouts, and social media embeds.
- Removed the manual colour scheme switch. Sorry to the fans of that feature; it's just too much annoying code for too minor functionality. I think I have a nicer way to reinstate it with much less code, but it'll take a little while.
- Removed collapsible tables of contents. Same issue: too much code, too little functionality.
