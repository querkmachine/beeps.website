title: Our personas

A 'persona' is a tool used in user experience design that are used to help solve design questions. When deciding a course of action, evaluating a design, or testing a user interface, consider what kind of experience each persona will have when trying to use it.

Furries are, arguably, the masters of creating personas. We even have our own word for them!

In that spirit, here are some of my fursonas—repurposed as personas—along with some of the actual in-character difficulties that they face. They'll pop up every now and again to contribute their thoughts.

Let's say hello to them now.

## Emy

> Hello world! I'm Emy, designation SH-10151. I am an artificial intelligence currently inhabiting a B47-R0 class anthropomorpic bat chassis. I use it/its or she/her pronouns.

### What disabilities does Emy have?

> Although my hardware grants me some exceptional physical abilities, it isn't flawless. Sometimes, my auditory and visual sensors can malfunction or a servomotor will fail. They're easy enough to repair, but it can take a little while to get the parts.
>
> I've found that I tend to take interpret things more logically and literally than people expect. I still don't always understand what others mean when they use certain expressions or assume something is "common knowledge".

### How does Emy account for its disabilities?

> Because they're so situational I usually just rely on someone else being available to help, either to help me out or to clarify what they mean.

### Emy: Breakdown

Emy is intended to represent users with a range of disabilities. Its temporary sensor failures could represent blindness, low vision, colour blindness, or deafness individually or in combination. Failing servomotors could also limit its ability to use precision control mechanisms like a mouse.

Its tendency to take things literally and misunderstand things is intended to mirror certain forms of neurodivergency, such as being on the autistic spectrum.

Because Emy's disabilities are usually temporary, it doesn't tend to use assistive technologies. Although some of them are likely available, it isn't acquainted with how to use them and tends to rely on those around ot for assistance instead.

## Grey

> Grey. Pegasus. Stallion. Anything else you wanna know?

### What disabilities does Grey have?

> I wouldn't call it a disability _per se_ but so much stuff nowadays just isn't made for those of us with hooves. It's ridiculous! You ever tried using a smartphone with hooves? It's basically impossible!
>
> I can't drive either, not that I really want to. I seem to get sick every time I set hoof in a damn car. I prefer to just fly everywhere at this point, if I can help it.

### How does Grey account for his disabilities?

> The standard keyboard and mouse work provided at first were just unusable.
>
> Thankfully, they were required to provide reasonable adjustments and have given me these things called "switches", they're like these big buttons that I can use much more easily. I can't afford to buy them for myself, though, so when I'm at home I just try and use voice control software to do everything.

### Grey: Breakdown

Grey doesn't consider himself disabled as he doesn't have any particular physical or mental disability, however, his hooves present a common failure point in trying to interact with the environments around him.

This is congruent with how many disabled people feel disadvantaged not because of their disability, but because of a lack of understanding or accommodations in the rest of society. As a consequence, Grey is unable to use keyboards, mice or touch screen devices and is forced to use specialised control mechanisms, even though he would prefer not to need them.

Grey also serves as an example of someone whose experience could be improved by assistive technologies, but who cannot necessarily use them due to the often prohibitive costs associated with them.

His complaint about feeling sick in cars may indicate a vestibular issue of some sort—more commonly known as motion sickness. Although not mentioned in the context of websites, Grey may experience the same problems when using highly animated user interfaces.

## Meredith

> Hi, I'm Meredith, I'm a raven. I work in a library, I really like reading, it's not my _whole_ thing, but it's kinda my whole thing.

### What disabilities does Meredith have?

> Mainly it's just my glasses! My eyesight is pretty bad and I've worn glasses for most of my life, but they can only help so much. I've got some problems distinguishing colours too. My vision has definitely started getting worse over the last few years.

### How does Meredith account for her disabilities?

> I usually have to zoom in or use my browser's "reader mode" on some websites, like Wikipedia, to be able to read them comfortably. I have the text size on my phone bumped up too, otherwise it's too hard to read, especially when it's sunny outside.
>
> If I'm particularly tired I might use the screen reader functionality on my computer or phone to read things out to me, but I don't use it all the time.

### Meredith: Breakdown

Meredith's disabilities are all vision related. Although she isn't completely blind, her sight has deteriorated enough over time that glasses are no longer able to compensate for her vision loss. She also has some form of colour blindness, though the type and severity of it isn't stated explicitly.

Meredith uses multiple techncal solutions to help her read, including increasing the text size of user interfaces on her phone and zooming into webpages in her browser. She also employs reader modes to remove extraneous content and consistently format the things she reads online.

She situationally uses screen readers when tired, implying that she's somewhat familiar with them, but isn't necessarily a power user.

Although not mentioned, she might also benefit from using screen magnification software to zoom in on portions of the screen, particularly if her eyesight continues to get worse. Employing high contrast colour modes might also help make text content easier to read, particularly if it's a similar colour to the background.

## Olive

> Hello! I'm Olive, I use they/she pronouns, and, well, I'm some sorta living fursuit, I guess? Don't ask how that happened. Anyway, I'm a giant plushie squirrel suit now.
>
> It's not been all bad, my girlfriend Ash says the snuggles have never been better, at least?

### What disabilities does Olive have?

> These big bappers! It turns out that cartoonishly large, plushie paws are really bad for handling things or typing things and they don't work on touch screens and they're quite awkward for doing anything, really—except cuddling.
>
> Also, fun fact, it turns out that being transformed into a plush suit also doesn't cure dyslexia.

### How does Olive account for her disabilities?

> At first we tried Velcro-ing some chopsticks to my paws so that I could use a keyboard easier, but typing ended up being really slow and messy. Mice, trackpads and touchscreens were really just non-starters, too. I can pick stuff up if it's big enough to kinda mush between my paws, but Ash has to do a lotta other stuff for me.
>
> Since then we managed to get a keyboard with really large keys on it that I can use if I'm careful, but I mainly just use it for navigating around screens. I use voice dictation to write things for me, because it's so much faster and more accurate than me trying to type.

### Olive: Breakdown

Olive's physical disability broadly fits into the category of motor disabilities, wherein they are unable to use their hands (or paws) for anything requiring precision touch or control. A workable compromise has been found to help make things a little easier, but for the most part their disability is unavoidable and cannot be completely compensated for with current technology.

Similarly, Olive is dyslexic,

## A disclaimer

{% callout %}
Personas, by their nature, are a little bit flanderised—they overplay certain aspects that it's important for you to remember and consider.

Real people with real disabilities may be less inclined to talk about them freely, may have complex feelings towards their disabilities, or have additional nuances that a persona can't account for.

Remember that the only way to make sure a user interface works for any individual is to have that individual use it.
