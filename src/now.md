  description: A basic overview of what I'm up to at the moment.

A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

💻 I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team. Currently, and for the last several months, I've been working on the upcoming GOV.UK brand refresh. I'm also assisting with updates to the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/) and have been iterating upon how I record and distribute [GOV.UK browser data]({{ '/govuk-browser-data/' | url }}).

🏥 Unfortunately, I'm dealing with a lot of health-related issues at the moment. Since the start of the year I've been diagnosed with asthma, hypertension, and sleep apnea. It's been a lot.

🎶 Lately, [I've been listening](https://www.last.fm/user/robomilk/library) to my whole library on shuffle, rediscovering music I've not listened to for a while. Also Eurovision happened, so I've been listening to entries from that for a while.

📺 [I'm watching](https://trakt.tv/users/batbeeps/history) _3 Body Problem_, _Murderbot_, _Jet Lag: The Game_, the new _Formula 1_ season, and various Dropout shows. As per usual, I'm rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ along with [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/).

📚 I'm currently (slowly) reading _The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet_ by John Green.

🎮 I've mostly been playing [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/), finally working out how schedules work. [Pokémon TCG Pocket](https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/) is also distracting me twice a day.

## Recently

😺 I've been doing a bit of work on [BristolFurs](https://bristolfurs.co.uk) website-related stuff.

🏳️‍🌈 I went to Birmingham for ConFuzzled 2025 and Cardiff for Pride Cymru, pride event of Wales.

## Soon

🇸🇪 I'm going to Stockholm for a long weekend at the end of June.

🏎️ In July, I'll be going to Bristol Pride and be attending the London e-Prix for the first time!

🫘 In September, I'll be seeing _[Three Bean Salad](https://linktr.ee/threebeansalad)_ live and might be headed to the London Podcast Festival again, depending on what the schedule is like.
