  description: A basic overview of what I'm up to at the moment.

A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

💻 I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team. Currently, and for the last several months, I've been working on the GOV.UK brand refresh and related work. I'm also writing WCAG understanding documents for the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

🇸🇪 I'm learning to speak Swedish! <span lang="sv">Jag pratar en lite svenska.</span>

🏥 Unfortunately, I'm dealing with a lot of health-related issues at the moment. Since the start of the year I've been diagnosed with asthma, hypertension, and sleep apnea. It's been a lot.

🎶 Lately, I saw Daði Freyr and Montaigne (Iceland and Australia's Eurovision entrants in 2020 and 2021) live, so [I've been listening](https://www.last.fm/user/robomilk/library) to them a whole lot!

📺 [I'm watching](https://trakt.tv/users/batbeeps/history) _Jet Lag: The Game_, _Taskmaster_, _Only Connect_, the new _Formula 1_ season, and various Dropout shows. As per usual, I'm rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ along with [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/).

📚 I'm currently (slowly) reading _The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet_ by John Green. I also randomly found this comic named _White House Robot Romance_, which is a weird but pretty neat concept.

🎮 I've mostly been playing [Factorio](https://factorio.com/), having fallen down that well **again**.

## Recently

📣 I've begun voice training and laser hair removal so that I can Be More Trans.

🎙️ I attended a bunch of live events, including the London e-Prix, a live edition of [the _Three Bean Salad_ podcast](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Bean_Salad_(podcast)>), and a concert for Daði Freyr (supported by Montaigne).

## Soon

🐾 I'll be attending Scotiacon in Glasgow in February, and ConFuzzled in Birmingham in May.
