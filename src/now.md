  description: A basic overview of what I'm up to at the moment.

A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

💻 I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team. I'm also writing WCAG understanding documents for the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

🇸🇪 I'm learning to speak Swedish! <span lang="sv">Jag pratar en lite svenska.</span>

🎶 [I've been listening](https://www.last.fm/user/robomilk/library) to a lot of stuff. See [this recent blog post]({{ '/blog/2025-12-20-in-2025/#a-musical-interlude' | url }}) for some of my favourites from 2025.

📺 [I'm watching](https://trakt.tv/users/batbeeps/history) _Pluribus_, _The Bear_, _The Boys_, _Only Connect_, and various Dropout shows. As per usual, I'm rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ along with [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/).

📚 I'm currently (slowly) reading _All Systems Red_ by Martha Wells and _The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet_ by John Green.

🎮 I've mostly been playing [Factorio](https://factorio.com/), having fallen down that well **again**. I've also gotten into playing _Cassette Beasts_ and _Super Animal Royale_ again, which are awesome games.

## Recently

🩵 At work, I've spent much of the last year working on the GOV.UK brand refresh (i.e. "it's blue now"). [I wrote a blog post about it]({{ '/blog/2025-06-25-the-not-quite-new-govuk-brand/' | url }}) that popped off a bit as well.

📣 I'm undergoing voice training and laser hair removal so that I can Be More Trans.

## Soon

🐕‍🦺 [The Year of Service.]({{ '/blog/2025-12-20-in-2025/#2026-is-the-year-of%E2%80%A6' | url }})

🐾 I'll be attending Scotiacon in Glasgow in February, and ConFuzzled in Birmingham in May.
