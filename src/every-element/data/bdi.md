Tells the browser that the contained text is written in a different direction (right-to-left or left-to-right) to the surrounding text, so that the browser knows to switch directions. For example, an Arabic name written in an English language article.

Modern browsers are usually quite capable of working this out themselves, however this element may be useful if the two are heavily intertwined.
