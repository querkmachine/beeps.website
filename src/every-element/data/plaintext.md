Displayed everything after it as pre-formatted text, not parsing HTML and maintaining the whitespace and line breaks of the source code. Weirdly, `plaintext` had no closing tag, so it could not be limited to only parts of a page.

Use the [`pre`](#pre) element with manually escaped HTML tags instead.
