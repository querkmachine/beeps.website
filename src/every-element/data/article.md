An independent, self-contained section of content, such that it could be separated from the surrounding context and still make sense. Common examples include articles, blog posts, forum posts and comments.

Articles may contain their own [`header`](#header) and [`footer`](#footer) elements, which will be scoped to the article. For example, to contain the title, publish date and other metadata about the article.
