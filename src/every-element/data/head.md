category: Sections of a page
spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-head-element
---

Surrounds all 'invisible' content on a webpage, that is machine-readable information (aka, metadata) about the document.

All webpages must contain a `head` element, even if it's empty, and there can only be one `head` element. If omitted, the browser will try to insert one when rendering the page.

Not to be confused with the visible [`header`](#header) element.
