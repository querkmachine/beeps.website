Used for embedding external content into a page, usually from an external application or a browser plugin.

Historically, this was commonly used for embedding Flash and Java content but has fallen out of use since. It has largely been superceded in modern times by more discrete elements like [`canvas`](#canvas), [`audio`](#audio) or [`video`](#video).
