Used for embedding external content into a page, usually from an external application or a browser plugin, in conjunction with [`object`](#object).

Historically, this was commonly used for embedding Flash and Java content but has fallen out of use since. It has largely been superceded in modern times by more discrete elements like [`canvas`](#canvas), [`audio`](#audio), and [`video`](#video).
