The heading elements—`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, and `h6`—represent a descending hierarchy that is used to structure the content that follows them.

Heading levels should descend in order throughout the document, without skipping levels, however they may jump to a prior level at any time.

Webpages should only have a single `h1` element, which contains the name of the page. All other headings should use one of the lower heading levels.
