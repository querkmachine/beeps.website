An experimental component that allows for greater visual customisation of [`select`](#select) elements, as part of the [customisable `select` specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select).

`selectcontent` is automatically populated with the currently selected [`option`](#option) of the containing `select` element, permitting the initial (closed) visual appearance of the `select` to be freely customised.

As an experimental component, it is currently not supported across all browsers and its usage is subject to future change.
