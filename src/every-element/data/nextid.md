A non-standard element that was proprietary to the NeXT web editor, the first HTML code editor. It instructed the editor which number to begin with when automatically generating `id` attributes for page headings and tables of contents. [Here's a page explaining the history and use of `nextid`](http://the-pope.com/nextid.html) if you're interested.

Has the distinction of being the first element to be removed from the HTML specification. Obviously does not work in any modern browser or HTML code editor.
