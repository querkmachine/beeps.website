Container element for content that appears in a dialog (variably known as a 'modal', 'modal window' or 'lightbox'). Dialogs appear 'above' the content of a page and can optionally prevent interaction with the rest of the page until the user makes an action that closes the dialog.

Useful examples of dialogs include confirmations that a user wants to do something, or certain multitasking situations, such as writing an email whilst still navigating around their inbox. Less useful examples include cookie conset dialogs and newsletter sign up forms.

Dialogs require JavaScript to be shown and hidden.
