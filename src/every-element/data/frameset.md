Container for multiple [`frame`](#frame) elements, which could be composited together to build a webpage out of multiple HTML documents.

The `frameset` element replaced the [`body`](#body) element when used.

Due to issues with performance and accessibility, framesets are obsolete and not all browsers support displaying them.
