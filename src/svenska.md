[I'm learning Swedish.]({{ '/blog/2025-07-09-pa-svenska/' | url }}) Keeping track of what words I know is kinda handy, as well as the little ways I've used to remember how to spell them.

This isn't an exhaustive list of stuff I've learned, some of them are easy enough to keep in memory, these are just the ones I have occassional trouble remembering, or remembering how to spell them.

This is mostly here for my own reference, so if you found this page, good sleuthing I guess?

{% callout %}
This is pretty much all based on my own research and deduction. Stuff might be wrong, but if it is, then I haven't learned that it's wrong yet. 🤷

## General rules and notes

### å, ä, ö

These are considered their own letters in Swedish, not a/o with diacritics added.

- å = pronounced like 'oa' in 'oar'
- ä = pronounced like 'eeh'
- ö = pronounced like 'uuh'

They come after the the 26 English alphabet characters in terms of sorting order.

### Noun gender

All nouns are either common gender (utrum) or neuter gender (neuterum). There are no hard or fast rules for what nouns use which gender—you just need to memorise them.

'en' is used for common gender nouns, 'ett' is used for neuter nouns. Knowing these are necessary for definite articles, where the gender affects the suffix of the word.

e.g. en hund (a dog) &rarr; hunden (the dog)
e.g. ett bi (a bee) &rarr; biet (the bee)

They're also used for adjective agreement.

e.g. en bil (a car) &rarr; en stor bil (a big car)
e.g. ett hus (a house) &rarr; ett stort hus (a big house)

And both together: e.g. stort huset (the big house)

As a general guideline, common gender is used for:

- most living things — like people, plants and animals
- days, months, seasons
- tools and utensils

Neuter gender is used for:

- diminutives of living things — children, babies
- geographical names
- abstract concepts
- materials
- nouns ending in -um or -eri

### Plurals

Most gendered nouns are pluralised by suffixing them with -ar.

e.g. jordgubbe (strawberry) &rarr; jordgubbar (strawberries)
e.g. tidning (newspaper) &rarr; tidningar (newspapers)
e.g. pojke (boy) &rarr; pojkar (boys)

Female gendered nouns may be suffixed with -or.

e.g. kvinna (woman) &rarr; kvinnor (women)
e.g. flicka (girl) &rarr; flickor (girls)

Neuter nouns do not change for their plural forms, so quantity must be determined by context.

e.g. bi (bee _or_ bees)
e.g. brev (letter _or_ letters)

#### Definitive plurals

Gendered definitive plurals are **additionally** suffixed by -na.

e.g. jordgubbar (strawberries) &rarr; jordgubbarna (the strawberries)
e.g. pojkar (boys) &rarr; pojkarna (the boys)
e.g. kvinnor (women) &rarr; kvinnorna (the women)

Neuter definitive plurals are suffixed by -en, instead of the -et that their definitive forms usually use.

e.g. biet (the bee) &rarr; bien (the bees)
e.g. brevet (the letter) &rarr; breven (the letters)

### Capitalisation

Other than the first letter of a sentence, only proper nouns (those of people, places, and brand names) are typically capitalised. Other nouns are always lower case.

e.g. de pratar engelska i England (they speak English in England)
e.g. jag är i Norge på juli (I am in Norway in July).

Abbreviations are also capitalised.

### Punctuation

Generally speaking, punctuation rules are mostly the same as in English.

#### Quotation marks

Quotation marks use 'end' quotations at both the start and end of the quote.

e.g. ”Hej! Jag heter är beeps.”

Some historical or 'fancy' cases use inward pointing guillemets instead of quotation marks.

e.g. »Hej! Jag heter är beeps.«

### Abbreviations

Abbreviations are truncated by use of a colon separating the first and last letters.

e.g. Sankt (Saint) can be shortened to S:t, such as in S:t Eriksplan

For ordinal numbers, the number is used instead of the first letter

e.g. tredje (third) can be shortened to 3:e

Colons are also used to separate suffixes (such as defintives, plurals, and posessives) where they may affect the reading.

e.g. b:et (the B)
e.g. CD:n (the CD)
e.g. USA:s (USA's)

### Dates and times

Dates are typically written as YYYY-MM-DD in modern documents. Times are written in the 24-hour clock, separated by a colon or period.

e.g. 2025-08-28 på 22:57

The expanded date format includes the day and month name in an order similar to British English.

e.g. torsdag 28 augusti 2025 (Thursday 28 August 2025)

### Numbers

Numbers use a space to separate thousands and a comma to separate decimals.

e.g. 12 345,67

### Currency

Sweden no longer issues physical currency in decimal amounts, the smallest coin value being 1 kr, but prices may still be fractional for the purposes of digital payments.

The Swedish kroner can be abbreviated to 'kr' or to 'SEK'. Both may appear before or after the value, separated by a space. 'kr' typically comes after, whereas 'SEK' comes before.

e.g. 29,50 kr
e.g. SEK 29,50

Foreign currency symbols appear after the value, separated by a space.

e.g. 9,99 €
e.g. 9,99 £

### Weights and measures

Metric weights and measures use the same names and abbreviations as in English.

e.g. 25 kg
e.g. 42 cm
e.g. 2 l

Imperial weights and measures use different names. Other than English stone, they are not abbreviated.

e.g. 5 fot (5 feet)
e.g. 6 tum (6 inches)
e.g. 82 pund (82 pounds)
e.g. 22 uns (22 ounces)
e.g. 12 eng. sten (12 English stone)

#### 'du' vs. 'ni'

Historically, 'du' is informal whereas 'ni' is formal. In the modern day, however, 'du' is used almost universally.

'Ni' remains as an optional way of showing deference and respect, and is more common in rural or traditional settings.

### Posessive pronouns

## Verbs

{% callout %}Many, many verbs end in 'ar' or 'er' sounds!{% endcallout %}

Verbs can be reversed by adding 'inte' after them.

e.g. du äter choklad (you are eating chocolate) &rarr; do äter inte choklad (you are not eating chocolate)

The actual prefix 'to' is 'att' for verbs. If a sentence is to begin with the verb (i.e. it is not being said about a specific subject) then start the sentence with 'att'.

e.g. du äter bra (you are eating good) &rarr; att äter bra (to eat good)
