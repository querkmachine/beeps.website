I don't actually touch type in the 'correct' way—by the time school bothered to teach it I'd already used computers enough to make up my own method.

As a result, I'm very right paw dominant when I type, about two thirds of the keyboard is used with my right paw, so I doubt I could go much faster than that.

I'd somehow convinced myself the Vanessa Carlton song couldn't be named “A Thousand Miles" because that's a Proclaimers song, and you can't have two songs with the same name cuz it'd be too confusing.

Anyway according to my brain the song is called “Homebound (Making My Way Downtown)” now.
