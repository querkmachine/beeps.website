  description: Cool sites on the information cyber highway that I like.

I am remiss that [websites these days don't just link to cool things anymore]({{ '/blog/2023-11-27-buttons/' | url }}). Of course, when I wrote that article, this website didn't do that either, so let's right that wrong.

Here's some lesser known neat webbed sites I like.

Of course, I'm not responsible for the content of any of these sites, which might change at any time without me noticing. I feel like I shouldn't need to clarify that.

## Blogroll

Blogs that I actively keep tabs on and read at least some quantity of the posts.

- [Adam Silver](https://adamsilver.io/) quite literally wrote [the book on form design](https://formdesignpatterns.com/) and his blog is one of the first places I tend to look when wondering how best to word a question or structure a form.
- [Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/) is a specialist in web accessibility, unafraid of doing deep dives into the nitty-gritty and loudly calling out the failures of major corporations alike. Truly an inspiration.
- [Dhole Moments](https://soatok.blog/) mostly writes about cryptography, technology, the furry fandom, and all the ways those things frequently intersect.
- [Food is Stupid](https://foodisstupid.substack.com/). This blog is cursed. This food is cursed. None of you are without sin. (Half the posts are behind a paywall, such is the business of blogging, but the rest of them are still excellent.)
- [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/) writes about all sorts of software things that I barely understand but find interesting anyway. Also where I stole the idea of having character callouts in blog posts, though my reasons are far less Socratic.

## Friends (and acquaintances) sites

Personal websites are _the bomb_. In an era where so much self-expression has moved to social media, having a website that is entirely your own is almost like an act of individual defiance. There are no linktrees or Squarespaces here.

Here's some websites belonging to people I am at least vaguely familiar with, because they deserve some link love. (And yes, quite a lot of them are furries.)

- [a_bat](https://a-bat.com/)
- [Alteran Labs](https://alteranlabs.co.uk/)
- [Caius Nocturne](https://nocturne.works/)
- [Cendyne](https://cendyne.dev/)
- [DarkOverord](https://darkoverord.info/)
- [David Cox](https://dav-idc.com/)
- [Dex the Dragon](https://dexthedragon.co.uk/)
- [Eevee](https://eev.ee/)

## Neat, niche YouTube channels

These channels are neat, and most of them don't even have a million subscribers, which is somehow not a lot these days.

- [Auto Schenanigans](https://www.youtube.com/@AutoShenanigans) has a bloke drive around the UK and sardonically tell you things about roads and petrol. He's kinda like one of those train YouTubers but for motorways.
- [Chain Bear](https://www.youtube.com/@chainbear) makes video essays about Formula 1 and motorsport, usually to explain some piece of technology or weird application of the rules. They're pretty calming, and proved quite useful when I was first getting into F1.
- [FUNKe](https://www.youtube.com/@FUNKe) makes cool, animated video essays about video games (and somehow the band Weezer without ever actually making a video _about_ Weezer). I can't say I play games (or Weezer) enough to really get it, but the presentation style is da bomb y'all.
- [The Infinite Review](https://www.youtube.com/@TheInfiniteReview) seeks to make a review about everything in the universe ever. It might take a while.
- [Jago Hazzard](https://www.youtube.com/@JagoHazzard) has a bloke train around London and sardonically tell you things about railway lines and rolling stock. He's kinda like one of those car YouTubers but for the London Underground.
- [Junkball](https://www.youtube.com/@JunkBallMedia) makes video essays about stupid things in _Star Trek_ and if that doesn't sell you then there's probably nothing here for you.
- [Linus Boman](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusBoman) makes videos about design and typography, ranging from history lessons to conceptual redesigns. Videos don't come often, but they're always exceptionally well produced and presented.
- [Marcel Vos](https://www.youtube.com/@MarcelVos) explains and breaks the RollerCoaster Tycoon games of my youth.
- [Noodle](https://www.youtube.com/@noodlefunny), like FUNKe, makes hella enjoyable animated video essays about video games (and sometimes other things).
- [Planet Clue](https://www.youtube.com/@planetclue) makes deep dive essays into technology and game franchises from the 90s and 2000s.

## Other neat spots

Miscellany, &c.

- [The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/) documents all the parts of video games that made it into the files but didn't make it into the final game. It's a fascinating insight into how popular games were developed and refined.
- [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com/) is a journey through the history of music genres all the way from Russian choir to 'deep deep tech house', all of them with example clips and a huge array of artist information and statistics.
- _[Meet Me In The Woods](https://mmitwcomic.tumblr.com/post/699016339886637056/cover-and-a-little-dedicatory-pagebecause-im-a)_ is a sci-fi mystery webcomic. It's also indirectly the source material for [my fursona]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}). I'm totally not biased.

## Buttons

These are largely sourced from [the 88x31 GIF Collection](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/), [the 88x31 Archive](https://hellnet.work/8831/) and [Yesterweb's buttons page](https://yesterweb.org/graphics/buttons).
