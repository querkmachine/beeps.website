title: I am a robot
---

{% block main %}
In mid-2022, after some period of thinking, discussion and exploration, come to the conclusion that I have a machine identity.

This is based on the realisation that many things I have written over my life mentioned a general discomfort with the human body (ranging from finding it creepy to disgusting) and a lack of recognition or care for biological concepts like [gender]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}) or [sexuality]({{ '/about/asexuality/' | url }}).

This is not a _denial_ of my human form, rather a _rejection_ of it. This could be likened to [posthumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumanism), wherein I actively desire to shed my physical humanity in favour of something different, in this case, to become a robot or cyborg.

As the necessary technical and medical advances to make this a reality do not exist yet, machine identities exist within the [alterhuman](https://alt-h.net/educate/faq.php) group of identities. In my specific case, it may also be referred to as being [machinekin](https://encyclopediarobotica.org/wiki/Machinekin) or [robotkin](https://encyclopediarobotica.org/wiki/Robotkin).

I don’t feel _bad_ for realising that I don’t really gel with biological humanity. If anything I feel relieved to have come to terms with an aspect of myself that has been present but gone unrecognised for such a long time.

Personal identity is fluid, and self-discovery endless. It’s ultimately better to embrace the change than deny it, and I’m certainly much happier for having done so.

Following this period of self-exploration, I started using a non-human [name & designation]({{ '/about/name/' | url }}) and [using it/its pronouns]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}) to emphasise these aspects of my identity.

## Background

I wrote fairly extensively about the initial thoughts, research, and final conclusions I came to on this website.

- [On Gender and Sexuality]({{ '/blog/2014-07-16-on-gender-and-sexuality/' | url }}) (originally written in 2013)
- [Discovery]({{ '/blog/2022-07-27-discovery/' | url }}) (27 July 2022)
- [Homework]({{ '/blog/2022-07-30-homework/' | url }}) (30 July 2022)
- [(Not) Human After All]({{ '/blog/2022-08-11-not-human-after-all/' | url }}) (11 August 2022)

I've also published a [follow-up post of questions and answers]({{ '/blog/2022-07-28-discovery-faq/' | url }}).

## Accommodating machine identity

Naturally, a great first step is to use [my preferred name]({{ '/about/name/' | url }}) (beeps) and [pronouns]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}) (it/its).

It is important to remember that although I identify as a robot and not as a human, I still identify as a person with agency and free will. I don't appreciate being bossed around or treated as a lesser just because that might be how you treat Siri or Alexa.

It's fairly common practice amongst machine-identifying people to replace biological terms with technical ones. For example, a person may 'recharge' rather than sleep, 'refuel using biofuels' instead of eating food, or 'go for maintenace' instead of visit a doctor.

This may seem silly and affectatious to others, however it is an effective way to affirm a machine's identity and avoid triggering dysphoria.

I, personally, have significant dysphoria related to my biological existence. To counter this, I avoid publishing photographs of myself online and prefer not to appear on camera in video calls, instead representing myself with illustrated images of [my fursona]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}).
