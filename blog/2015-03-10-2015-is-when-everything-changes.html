title: 2015 is when everything changes

<p>
  I’ve been lax updating this blog. I’ve been meaning to update it for literally
  months, but I’ve been procrastinating something fierce. I historically don’t
  like talking about my problems, and I think that sense was crawling back to
  me.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless, some (though not much) progress has been made. More people than
  ever now know of my identity and intentions, and I’m logistically closer to
  living my day-to-day life as I actually want—a process that can be expidited
  once I’ve managed to move out.
</p>

<p>
  I know it’s a slow process, and it feels as slow as ever; but as long as some
  progress is being made then I feel like I can get through it.
</p>

<p>I hope that 2015 can be the year when everything changes.</p>
