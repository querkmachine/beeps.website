  Alas, nothing really to report. Nothing heard from doctors or clinics, not
  come out to anyone new, no huge progress on the family front, not bought any
  nice clothes; I’m basically at a standstill for the time being.

  I’ve not even presented publicly for a while (barring a single day last week).
  All the women’s clothing I have is decidedly summery, and it’s quite nippy now
  that the weather’s turning cold. I intend to procure some warmer clothing
  soon.

  Things shall hopefully be picking up soon though. Months back I postulated
  that I should get a week off work and have a “Kim week” where I could just
  relax, be myself, and probably treat myself a bit—that’s happening in a couple
  of weeks, so hopefully that’ll go well.

  I’ve also been helping a few other friends who are now questioning their
  gender identity. Other than that, business as usual. I suppose that’s it for
  now.
